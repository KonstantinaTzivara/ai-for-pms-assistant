A practical AI-powered tool that helps project managers understand tech concepts in context
 AI for PMs Assistant

👩‍💼 What It Is

AI for PMs is a simple, AI-powered tool designed to help **non-technical project managers** understand complex tech concepts — like APIs, cloud, or machine learning — in **plain English and real project context**.

This is my personal project to showcase:
- Technical thinking
- Project management planning (Jira + Confluence)
- Usability for real-world SaaS/consulting roles
- AI integration with GPT models

 🧠 Why I Built This

I noticed that many PMs struggle to follow technical discussions or ask the right questions. This tool helps them:
- Understand concepts **on demand**
- See how tech terms show up **in real projects**
- Build confidence and bridge the gap with developers


💡 What It Does (MVP)

✅ Concept Explorer  
Search tech terms like `API` or `Load Balancer` and see:
- A short, plain-English definition
- How it appears in real projects
- What a PM should ask or know
- A metaphor to make it stick
- Links to trusted documentation (AWS, MDN, etc.)

Built using:
- `Streamlit` for frontend
- `JSON` file for data structure (scalable for new concepts)
- Clean, PM-first UX with clarity and focus


 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: **Streamlit**
- Data: **JSON**
- Language: **Python**
- Planning: Jira + Confluence (linked below)
