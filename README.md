A practical AI-powered tool that helps project managers understand tech concepts in context
# AI for PMs Assistant

## 👩‍💼 What It Is

AI for PMs is a simple, AI-powered tool designed to help **non-technical project managers** understand complex tech concepts — like APIs, cloud, or machine learning — in **plain English and real project context**.

This is my personal project to showcase:
- Technical thinking
- Project management planning (Jira + Confluence)
- Usability for real-world SaaS/consulting roles
- AI integration with GPT models

- Understand concepts **on demand**
- See how tech terms show up **in real projects**
- Build confidence and bridge the gap with developers
